# McDonald's Market Segmentation Analysis

This project performs a market segmentation analysis for McDonald’s using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify distinct customer segments based on behavioral and perception-based attributes and extract actionable business insights.



## Project Overview

Market segmentation helps businesses understand different customer groups and design targeted marketing strategies.  
In this project, clustering techniques are applied to McDonald’s customer data to uncover meaningful segments and analyze their characteristics.

The analysis is implemented entirely in a **Jupyter Notebook**, focusing on data exploration, preprocessing, clustering, and interpretation.



## Methodology

1. Data Exploration
   - Dataset inspection and understanding feature distributions
   - Identification of patterns and trends

2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values (if any)
   - Feature scaling and transformation

3. Dimensionality Reduction
   - Use of PCA for visualization and noise reduction (if applicable)

4. Clustering
   - Application of K-Means clustering
   - Determination of optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method / other metrics

5. Segment Profiling
   - Analysis of each cluster’s characteristics
   - Visualization of customer segments
